# coursera-skip
Module to facilitate skipping Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/) videos.

## Why?
Skipera assists in automatically skip irrelevant MOOC courses which are made mandatory by universities. 
Many of such courses are allotted directly by the university as credit fillers and are not in the interest of the student. The progress of the completion of these courses is tracked by the university and credits are allotted.

## How?
Skipera makes use of the Coursera web API and completes the videos + reading materials.
Surveys are not automatically completed since they are graded, thus needing user interaction to complete.

## How to use
* A sample config is provided in the repo. For now, cookie auth has been implemented since login requires reCaptcha.
* Add your cookies to example config as key:value pairs (simple python dict). The presence of the "CAUTH" cookie is important.
* Rename `config_example.py` to `config.py`
* `python3 main.py course-slug` where course-slug is present in the Coursera Course URL. Example: "introduction-psychology" (without the quotes) if the URL is https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-psychology/home/module/2.
